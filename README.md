# üß† AI Image Generator

A React-based project that allows users to generate AI-powered images using OpenAI's DALL¬∑E API.

---

## üîê OpenAI API Key Setup

To use this project, you need an OpenAI API key to generate images.

### üßæ Steps to Get Started:

1. Go to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and log in or sign up.
2. Generate a new API key.
3. In the root of this project, create a `.env` file.
4. Add the following line to the `.env` file:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

---

### `npm run eject`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.  
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them.

All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.  
At this point you're on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`.  
The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature.
